## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

This organization is the parent organization of:

1. [AkulAI](https://github.com/Akul-AI)
2. [Hello World Games](https://github.com/Hello-World-Games)

This is where we post code that is commonly used between our organizations so we can avoid rewriting important code every time. It's also the place where we manage our other organizations, and put any standalone apps which don't really need their own organization.
